                    The Scarbrough Hotel stands on the site where, in former days, there was a moated, mediaeval manor house.
                    <br>
                    Lavishly rebuilt in 1765 it had gardens extended to the river with superb views. As industrialisation in Leeds grew the residence was surrounded
                    by workshops and soon became unsuitable as a residence.
                    <br>
                    In 1816 the estate was subdivided and in 18126 Henry Scarbrough took the property, which became the Kings Arms, an extensive hotel patronised by many distinguished guests.
                    <br>
                    The Hotel prospered until about 1863 when the railway viaduct and Queens Hotel were built nearby. 
                    <br>
                    In the late 1890’s Fred Wood took over and renamed the venue The Scarbrough Hotel, named after Henry Scarbrough, it’s previous owner. 
                    <br>
                    He started a great connection with Leeds City Varieties which he also owened. At the time the Scarbrough boasted a large concert hall where acts showing promise would then be put on at the Varieties.
